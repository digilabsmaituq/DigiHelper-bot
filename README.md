# DigiHelper Bot
A bot for Digilab Discord Server based on Discord py. If you are from Digilab and want to run this bot on your computer, make sure you already have discord.py on your system.
If you haven't already, install discord.py by running this command on your terminal:
```
pip install discord.py
```

If you already have discord.py installed, create a `config.json` file on the bot folder and write this down:
```
{
  "TOKEN": "",
  "ADMIN_ROLE": "",
  "OS": ""
}
```
> Please ask our team members about the token and admin role. For the "OS" key, use "python3" value if you are using Linux, and "python" if you are using Windows.
